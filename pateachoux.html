<h1>How to make Pate a Choux Dough</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<img src="creampuffs.jpg"align="right" height="500"/>
<p>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter</p>
<p>3/4 cup water</p>
<p>1 cup all purpose flour</p>
<p>1/8 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p>4 eggs</p>


<h2>Yield</h2>
<p> 40 to 45 cream puffs</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
	Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In 2 quart pot, combine the butter and water. On a piece of wax or parchment paper, sift together the flour, salt and sugar. Bring the water and butter to a rolling boil, remove from heat and dump the flour mixture in all at once. Stir with a wooden spoon or paddle to incorporate.
</p>
<p>
	Return the saucepot to high heat and cook, stirring, for about one minute. The mixture will form a ball and coat the pan with a thin film.
</p>
<p>
	Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl or standing mixer equipped with the paddle attachment. Mix the dough for a minute or so, on low speed, to release some of the heat. Add the eggs, one at a time, completely incorporating each one before adding the next. Beat until the dough gets thick and ribbony.
</p>
<p>
	Fit a pastry bag with a round #5 tip and fill with the warm dough. Line a heavy cookie sheet with parchment paper and anchor it to the tray with a little dab of the dough at each corner. Pipe about forty to forty five 1 1/2-inch mounds about 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden and puffed. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for another 10 minutes or until they are golden brown and there are no droplets of moisture in the crevices. Turn off oven and leave the choux to dry for another 10 minutes. Use when cool, or freeze, wrapped in a plastic bag, for 2-3 months.
